## General Info
For the actual STEM night, as well as other outreach events,
this is meant to be used with a joystick that has at least
11 buttons. For testing purposes, however, an xbox controller
can be used.

In `/src/main/cpp/Robot.cpp`,<br>
If using with a joystick, add `#define JOYSTICK 1`,<br>
For xbox controllers, add `#define JOYSTICK 0`.
